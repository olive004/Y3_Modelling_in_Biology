% 9. Confirm the results of the previous two parts by using Matlab’s ode45 to numerically integrate model (3)
% for ? = 0.5 and ? = 1.2. Use an initial simulation time of 0 and a final simulation time of 20. For each
% value of ? plot 11 trajectories on the same figure with initial conditions z0 = 0, z0 = 0.1, . . . , z0 = 1.
% Use different colours for each trajectory (for allocating random colours, you might want check out the
% command hold all in MATLAB). (15/100)
% 10. Say the fishermen want to maximise the long-term (asymptotic) amount of fish harvested per unit time.
% What proportion of the stock of fish would you recommend them to harvest per unit time (i.e., what
% should the optimal value of q be)?
